        <h1><u>The beginning of Arcator</u></h1>
        <b><u>Nov 2010 as a friend group</u></b>
        <br>
        There were just three friends—<b>Fela, Maren, and Jma</b>. Three teens from <b>London</b>. They wanted to make an MC server back when Minecraft was still in Alpha. In <b>November</b>, it started—a time mostly cloaked in mystery now, with hardly any videos to remember it by. The server was meant to be a <b>creative one</b>, at a time when most of Minecraft was <b>survival</b>. People were given commands to <b>/give</b> because <b>gamemodes didn’t yet exist</b>. And despite that, they began to build.
<br>
<b><u>Dec 2010 became publicly</u></b>
<br>
        As <b>December</b> came, new people joined by word of mouth. Many built <b>homes</b>, some made <b>pixel art</b>, and even a giant city was constructed—<b>suspended in the sky</b>. Despite players not being able to fly, they called it <b>SkyCity</b>, one of the largest builds.
        
        As December came to a close, <b>Minecraft Beta</b> was approaching. A new player joined by the name <b>Kieraan</b> they offered to help as an <b>admin</b>, while <b>Llanoc</b> a vetarin member by that time became one of the <b>first moderators</b>. The <b>spawn was prepared</b> as someting big was about to happen, the friends counted down, and just like that, the server <b>took flight</b>. It had grown from a small friend group into a <b>public server</b>. From just three friends, <b>Arcator had begun</b>.

        <h1><u>The down fall of Arcator</u></h1>
        —<b><u>2011</u></b>—
<br>

The server grew rapidly, with a <b>dozen new people joining each day</b>. The <b>player count surged</b>, and soon, every day, there were at least <b>ten others online</b>. The <b>chat buzzed</b> with activity, while some players stayed on <b>IRC</b>, watching the conversations unfold—the old kind of <b>Discord</b>.

From 2011 to 2012, more than <b>3,000 people joined</b> from all over the world. This was the <b>golden age</b>. The community was thriving, filled with <b>creativity, friendships</b>, and endless builds.

But slowly, in <b>2012</b>, cracks began to show. The <b>first set of staff</b> started to resign—first one, then several more, week by week. The once-solid foundation of leadership was beginning to weaken.

<b>Maren</b>, the original owner, started preparing for succession and chose a new owner named <b>Banana</b>. <b>Jma</b> had disappeared, and <b>Fela</b> was beginning to move on as well. By <b>mid-2012</b>, Arcator had technically <b>peaked</b>, and the <b>decline had begun</b>.

<b>Fall 2012</b> was a time of many events, but most were never completed. The server, once updated regularly, began to <b>fall behind</b>. It became <b>harder to discover</b> and a hassle to join, as newer <b>Minecraft versions outpaced it</b>.

<b>2013</b> was a <b>slow burn</b>. People still hoped for a <b>revival</b>, shared ideas, and waited. In a last attempt to save it, <b>Banana rebooted Arcator</b>—not as a creative server, but as a <b>factions server</b>. But before he could finish, <b>interest had already faded</b>.

The <b>last players finally left</b>. The website, once full of activity, became a place of scattered posts. The server, once thriving, now lay dormant. <b>Arcator had started as a massive creative server</b> and ended as a <b>small SMP</b>.
