    <h1 id="title">Tale of Chickens; Mooshroom Island</h1>
<p>one day
in that empty forest
surrounded by just my tall cobble tower
housing the signs
and the single house on the mountain
I looked down and saw, a single egg
I don't know where that egg came from
but I ran back to my house
in front of the signs of the ancients
I dug a hole
2 deep
and threw the egg inside
a baby chicken emerged
!!
I went back to the jungle, cutting some more
came back
the chicken grew
laid some eggs
I threw the eggs back at the hole
more babies emerged 
each day I went back to the jungles
gathering a full chest
then doubles
of logs
"maybe one day this will be useful to someone"
while the chicken hole grew
eventually I brought seeds
and they grew faster
I gathered up two stacks of eggs
and walked back outside the tower
looking at the silent forest
I aimed my camera up into the sky
held down right click-
and listened as each egg flew out of my hand
32 eggs later
arcing off into the distance
they disappeared behind the trees
I never saw where they landed
but each time I now repeated that
coming back to them
getting their eggs
and throwing them around
the next day I was walking back to my home, in the tower
when I passed through the forest
I saw chickens walking around
there was sound again
the map was slowly awakening
on one of my journeys out
to search for relics
I came across a very strange village
the buildings looked..custom
as I got closer
I saw an enchantment table
half surrounded by books
I was shocked
the rest of the map was stone tools
what was this
I eventually found one home 
full of double chests
with iron
and a few diamonds
they're rich-
and inside I saw signs
written in a foreign language
I couldn't understand
still the village was cool
they had a big bridge over a river 
and I just knew
whoever these people were
they made it further than the other ghosts
I went back home again
on the 25th of august
I wanted to search for more relics
       so I packed up some blocks
       plenty of wood
       and set out
       I ran 500 blocks
       through the silent forest
       past the mountain
       that looked down upon the mysterious village
       I ran through the plains
       2000 blocks
       and through another chain of mountains
       4000 blocks
       I soon realized
       maybe,
       I had gone too far to find things
       if I wanted to find relics
       they would be close to spawn
       not this far out
       but I had to keep going-
       at 6000 blocks
       I reached water
       it was a small inlet
       I crossed it
       and walked through a short jungle
       ahead of me
       lay the ocean
       I made a boat
       it was nightfall
       but even monster spawning was bugged
       I set out
       I sailed another 1000 blocks
       far distant and alone
       eventually I saw a tiny island
       hardly 10 x 10 blocks long and wide
       I dug up some dirt
       and made a simple pixel art
       HI
       maybe one day someone would see it
       I got my boat
       and kept going
       I sailed past
       some more islands
       but at 7000 blocks
       something told me to turn
       so I turned 45 degrees
       and kept going
       and then
       by pure luck
       I saw a massive island
       in the distance
       I dismounted my boat
       it was a mooshroom island
       under dusk
       I walked around
     there were mooshrooms
       it was interesting to me
       the silent forest was the first few hundred blocks
       by 1000 blocks,
       I saw animals again
       that hadn't been killed
       now, 7000 blocks
       and feeling at the ends of the earth
       I walked an island
       no one had likely found
       and it was peaceful
       I knew monsters couldn't spawn
       
       
       but something felt poetic
       that on this island
       I was perfectly safe
       technically I could get unlimited soup
       I would never starve
       I could "live" here
       forever
       but if I stayed
       I would never ever
       find the relics
       I would be far from the tower of signs
       or the tale of chickens
       this had life
       but it wasn't worth living
       eventually
       the sun began to come back
       rising over the water
       in the same direction I had been travelling
       as if asking me to keep going forward
       instead
       using the buggy commands I knew
       I typed /spawn
       
       
       and the server counted
       You are now teleporting
       Move to cancel
       5
       4
    I thought to myself
       "I can cancel right now, and stay a bit longer"
       3
       2
       "no, I need the relics"
       "the history"
       1
       the map flashed
       loaded
       and then I found myself
       
       back home
       to the sound of chickens
       in the hole
       the search for history
       had to continue
       </p>
